    <string name="fragment_guide_welcome">Welcome</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_welcome_message">How do you quit apps?\nPressing Back always means that you finished your work and wanted to quit.\nPressing Home would start the launcher and kick this app into background.</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_welcome_message2">We love this design of Android, but some apps do not. They keep them in backgroud and drain your battery, some even push useless notifications to draw your attention.\n\nAnd Brevent is going to protect your phone from these apps.\nSwiping away from Recent Screen or pressing Back, they would be force-stopped.\nPressing Home and they would be kept in the background to finish their tasks, once the time period you set is out they would be force-stopped.\n\nFor background apps, Brevent shows the idle time dynamically.</string>

    <string name="fragment_guide_permission">Permissions</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_permission_message">What do you need to do? \nJust a simple command with your PC.</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_permission_message2">Some similar apps require root access or modifying your unlocked device. Debugging mode doesn\'t require root access, nor unlocking, it\'s much safer to use. \n\nThere is an experimental ROOT feature, allowing you to skip turning on debugging mode, even starting Brevent service when completed booting. You can press Back 7 times on \"Please start Brevent service\" page, or press \"Version\" 7 times in \"Settings\". ROOT mode is unsafe and unnessary, we do not offer support for those who prefer ROOT mode.</string>

    <string name="fragment_guide_security">Security</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_security_message">We need debugging mode to launch our Brevent without rooting your device. However, debugging mode is not safe enough, we strongly recommend you turn it off after starting Brevent service successfully.</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_security_message2">Brevent uses plenty of Android\'s hidden APIs. Some third-party ROMs may modify these API, so there would be some issues when using.</string>

    <string name="fragment_guide_enjoy">Enjoy</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_enjoy_message">Enjoy Brevent, and feel free to feedback.</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_enjoy_message2">The default Brevent method is \"App Standby\"(since Android 6.0). If you find some apps still running, please use Brevent or other tools to check its status.\n\nAnd to increase battery performance, Brevent server delay the processes by 3 to 60 seconds according the event level.\n\nWhen you swipe apps away from recent screen, Android will kill the processes and Brevent would force-stop them ASAP.</string>

    <string name="fragment_guide_adb">ADB</string>
    <string name="fragment_guide_adb_message">ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command-line tool that lets you communicate with an Android device. It\'s part of platform-tools, you can download it from here: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html (Long press, then select and copy).</string>
